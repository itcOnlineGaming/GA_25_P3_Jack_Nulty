# Guide
## Setting up Component

You need to add the component to your project using the Package Manager. Open the Package Manager (Windows > Package Manager), click on the + icon and select “Add package from git URL...” and enter:

https://github.com/itcOnlineGaming/GA_25_P3_Jack_Nulty.git?path=/GameObjectGridBuilder/Packages/ie.setu.gameobjectgridbuilder#v0.0.1

Note that the URL specifies the complete path to the package and a git tag. The package should now be visible in your project.

## Using the component
### Basic Grid
To create a basic grid you need to instantiate a grid and hotbar system.
You then need to apply prefabs from your game or application to each hotbar slot which will create instantations on the click of these buttons to be dragged into grid slots.
This can be done using touch-screen and mouse clicks.
